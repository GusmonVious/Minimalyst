              <h2>What is <span class="accent">Minimalism</span>?</h2>
              <p>Minimalism is intentionally living with only the things you really need—those items that support your purpose and add value to your life. By removing the excess, you create space for what truly matters.</p>
              <p>It's about finding freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we've built our lives around. Real freedom isn't about having everything—it's about having enough and appreciating it.</p>

              <p>Minimalism allows you to focus on what's important, reduce anxiety, and create more time and energy for the things you love. By owning less, you'll spend less time cleaning, organizing, and maintaining possessions.</p>
              <p>Studies show that people who embrace minimalism report higher levels of happiness, better financial health, and improved relationships.</p>

              <p>Minimalism and sustainability go hand in hand. By consuming less, you directly reduce waste, energy usage, and resource depletion. Each item not purchased is one less item that requires natural resources to produce and eventually dispose of.</p>
              <p>Making intentional choices about what you bring into your life helps create a more sustainable future for our planet.</p>
